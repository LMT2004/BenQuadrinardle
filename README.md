Daily Word game inspired by Wordle and Star Wars.

I used a random Sci-Fi name generator of my own design to populate a large JSON file with fake Star Wars names.
Then I used AI to compile a list of obscure Star Wars names, such as background or comic characters.
Reads your systems time to provide a new puzzle each day. Each day's puzzle is the same for everyone.

The idea is that the system gives you four names. Three are randomly generated, and one of them is a real Star Wars character, you have to guess which!
People with extreme Star Wars knowledge may recognize a few of the characters, but I highly doubt anyone knows a large percentage of them.

Feel free to visit the site any time, as there will be something new every day!
